# Paper Summarization

This is a class project for CMPE 297, Natural Language Programming, for the Fall 2022 semester. We use research paper summarization algorithms to automatically generate the abstract and introduction given an input paper.

# Collecting the dataset

The `collect_dataset.ipynb` notebook can be used to download and format a collection of papers and save them in .json format.
